Introduction:

FlexBase is a habit tracker application designed to help individuals manage their time more effectively and get their daily habits in check, so they can move towards a more organized and healthier lifestyle.

Motivation:

When we were trying to decide what application to create, we approached this question with the idea of being a genuinely helpful tool to all kinds of people, especially students. Having experienced poor time management ourselves, we decided that a tool that could improve one’s quality of life through improved time management and scheduling while also assisting in a generally healthier lifestyle would fulfill this purpose well, and that’s how we came up with the idea for FlexBase.

Installation:

We have decided to use a Java based stack, using Swing to develop our GUI and Spring Boot to accelerate our application development process and make it efficient from front to back.

You can install and use this app on your computer by doing the following (The working version of the app is in the Merge-Test branch):
- This app makes use of a MySQL Database, so install a local MySQL server and get the server running.
- Use the Flexbase_schema.sql file provided in the Database folder to create the schema.
- Make sure you have the connector/J plugin installed on your IDE (Eclipse), provided in the Libraries folder.
- The app is now ready to run at its current functional level, and inputs all habits and priority levels into the database.

Contribution: 

We use GitHub Desktop to coordinate all commits and changes being made to the project by each member, updating changes to new branches before committing to main at the end of the day.

Our branches are named after the sub-topic being altered and the version number.

Since we have direct communication between all members, we do not use pull requests but instead use our meetings to confirm changes and push to main branch.
