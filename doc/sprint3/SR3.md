## Practices to Continue Using
- Continue mid-sprint check-ins & demos to ensure the program works as intended.
- Continue code reviewing with each-other to uphold our coding standards.
- Continue helping each other when stuck/struggling to comprehend something (i.e. how does function X work, etc).


## New Practices to Use for Next Sprint
- Encourage cross-team code review (we have been doing this)
- Encourage more code-pushing (i.e. more commits. we have been doing this)
- Encourage more balanced schedules for members
- Encourage confidence in commits 
- Encourage more Trello tracking/relation in our commits

## Harmful Practices to Stop 
- Stop working so much near the deadline (at this point, it's like a habit to do this).
- Stop worrying about/being afraid of commiting to main on github, we can always revert our mistakes!

## Best/Work Experience in Sprint 3

- (Group) - I believe the worst or roughest experience so far in Sprint 3 was making sure that the DB was working effectively with our code. We were having issues with connecting Eclipse to SQL and ensuring that all members could use the DB and app correctly.
- (Group) - Our best experience was getting our Calendar and Login system finally working! It was a crucial component in our App, and getting our key addons working gave us a great feeling of success. Additionally, it was very rewarding to finally have a near-completed App for us to actually use!
