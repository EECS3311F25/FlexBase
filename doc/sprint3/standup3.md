1. What did you work on since the last standup? 
- Calender implementation fully completed 
- Algorithm optimization system active, but not effective.
   
2.  What do you commit to next? 
- Improve the algorithm optimization system, but if it is too ambitious of a system to implement, we will have to compromise due to lack of skill/time.

3. When do you think you'll be done?
- essentially our app is finished, but I anticipate by the end of Sprint 3 will we complete our app and finalize the project.

4. Do you have any blockers?
