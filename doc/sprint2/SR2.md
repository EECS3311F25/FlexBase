## Practices to Continue Using
- Continue mid-sprint check-ins & demos to ensure the program works as intended.
- Continue assisting each other in debugging code, perform code review (i.e. SQL, Java, Java Swing)


## New Practices to Use for Next Sprint
- Encourage more code review amongst members
- Encourage more code-pushing (i.e. more commits.)
- Encourage more balanced schedules for members

## Harmful Practices to Stop 
- Stop working so much near the deadline (once again), and ensure we understand what we code.
- Remember to work as a team → It’s a group project! 

## Best/Work Experience in Sprint 1

- (Group) - I believe the worst or roughest experience so far in Sprint 2 was making sure that our team’s SQL Servers were linked and working properly with Eclipse. We were having issues with linking tables, opening and running code, and generally ensuring our DB to Code connection is working. 
- (Group) - best experience so far was working as a team, but also having fun and remembering that this is a group project, we work together for a reason!
