# Project Objectives

The plan of this project is to develop a simple, straightforward activity/habit tracking system that assists users in improving their time management, encouraging healthy routines, and tracking their progress over time. This project is designed to help users achieve their desired changes in life through simplicity and effectiveness.

## Key Personas
### University Students
#### Cyrus Brown, a student juggling life and engineering studies
- Often struggles with planning, managing assignment due dates, and needs a balanced schedule that encourages both education and personal time.
- Needs help ordering his tasks and forming consistent habits (e.g., sleep, study, exercise, social life, all end up being overshadowed by work due to poor planning).

### Working Adults
#### Stella Woods, a 28-year-old software engineer at a large tech company
- Want to adopt healthier daily routines while tackling her busy schedules.
- Common challenges include inconsistent sleep, frequent (and often poorly timed) meetings, and lack of work-life balance.
#### Logan Sherwood, a 35-year-old construction worker & single father
- Works longs hours and spends his spare time after work drained, resulting in activities like watching TV or drinking
- Wants to change, and needs a more productive lifestyle but scheduling takes more energy than he has to spare.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Tracking Self-Growth & Daily Activities/Habits
#### A user wants to track how consistent they are with routines.
- The system provides logging capabilities for habits/activities.

### 2. Suggestion System & Showcasing Ideal Productivity Times/Days
#### A user wants to understand their trends of when they’re most & least productive.
- The system creates trend charts showing progress and consistency levels, helping users identify work patterns and improvement areas.

### 3. Motivation for Maintaining & Building Good Habits / Completing Tasks
#### Users are more likely to continue routines when they are motivated and can see progress (e.g., visual streaks).
- A gamified streak system encourages users to maintain habits or complete scheduled tasks by rewarding consistency.

### 4. Personalized Scheduling Recommendations / Adjustments
#### Users may need to change plans or feel stressed by their workload.
- The system provides recommendations that adapt the schedule based on:
  - Priority of activities
  - Time remaining before deadlines
  - Habit/task frequency and importance

## Key Scenarios (Based On Use Cases)

#### Cyrus adjusts his weekly schedule to prepare for his assignments!
 After clocking in minimal study hours last week, Cyrus notices an upcoming assignment due and alters his schedule to prioritize his assignment while ensuring his sleep routine remains unchanged. 
#### Logan changes his wasteful evening activities!
The system realizes Logan logged a reading event previously but missed it, therefore it decides to re-suggest it. Logan agrees, and starts a streak, finding it easier to do than wasting his evenings on the couch.
#### Stella finally has a proper morning routine!
The system warns Stella that she might lose her workout streak. She alters her morning to fit in a workout before her next meeting. 

## Key Design Principles


- **Simple and Efficient:** The interface and features are intentionally simple in order for quick, effective usage of the system.

- **Peace of Mind:** The user will always know what they want to do next, as the interface will make it obvious. No thinking should be needed to streamline their decision-making. 

- **Beneficial Data:** Visualizations should show the user's trends and potentially suggest changes (e.g., "You're consistent on Wednesday, but not Monday, want to make a change?"), data shouldn't be dumped and left to the user to interpret their trends.
