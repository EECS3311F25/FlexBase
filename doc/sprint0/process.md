# Process



## How did we make decisions? 
→ We decided to perform group meetings in order to collectively organize tasks and assign responsibilities based on common consensus. We used these meetings to ensure we had multiple perspectives on ideas before making final decisions. These meetings were beneficial in organizing our workflow and sequence.
→ We chose to assign responsibilities based on our team’s respective strengths and capabilities, allowing us to work with a level of independence outside of the meeting.

## How did we organize our team? 
→ We began by figuring out our initial goals for Sprint 0, and then breaking it down into individual tasks to be completed. We then volunteered and chose to assign responsibilities based on our team’s respective strengths and capabilities, allowing us to work with a level of independence outside of the meeting.
→ In addition to this, we collectively agreed to share technical skills that we are each confident in, which would allow us to have a team on an even playing field in terms of skill and joining components of the project. 
→ We all have varying skill levels in using Git, Java, Java Swing, etc., therefore teaching each other these frameworks/languages will enable us to perform better as a group when it comes to programming and outlining our project.
→ In terms of tools, we’ve used when2meet in order to figure out ideal teams to host team meetings & check-ins, alongside using discord as our meeting platform due to ease of access.

## How did you make decisions?
→ For decisions, we pose our question or idea as a meeting topic, and briefly meet to come to a conclusion. The flexibility of the group allows most members to meet even outside of scheduled meeting times, and if any members cannot attend, they are caught up to the topic in a separate meeting after. When all members' opinions are collected, the outcome is discussed until a unanimous decision is reached. 

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
→ Looking at the ideal use-case of our product from the eyes of the user allowed the user stories to be created from realistic perspectives with understandable levels of priority, especially since the product is one we envisioned even ourselves to find use in.

How frequently did you meet?
→ We decided to meet twice a week, one meeting to set our basis on what tasks we have to do at hand (i.e., what we need to implement, design, review), and an additional meeting in case members have any questions, doubts or problems they’re dealing with.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
→ Scheduling meeting times and topics well in advance as well as conducting more frequent check-ins help to balance independence with cooperation. This gives us more time to prepare for what will be discussed, meet with less delay, and ensure higher levels of productivity from less time wasted.
→ Ensure all members are on the same page in terms of tools and systems they will use. This gives us the opportunity to be working together on various parts of the project without anyone struggling with understanding what they are working on.
