## How is our product different?

Our product focuses on simplicity without ‘in-the-face’ features. While many of our competitors have a plethora of features, it gets to a point where it may overwhelm the user. We want to focus on clarity and simplicity, not an overwhelming amount of features.  

Furthermore, many of our competitors do not provide schedule suggestions or rearrangements, and are therefore ‘static’. We want users to understand that their schedule is adaptable based on their situation (i.e. urgency, stress load).  

Lastly, although our competitors may include a gamification aspect, we want to blend this gamification and provide progress charts and visual feedback so the user understands that this isn’t merely a ‘game’ but something that benefits them in life as well.  

## Is our product better for specific users/scenarios?

Our target users for our product are students & professionals who struggle with finding a work/life balance, people changing lifestyles (i.e. new job, moving, etc), and generally people who struggle with finding focus on what they need to do.  

## Key Scenarios
- Users who need adjustable schedules due to varying work/life situations.  

- Users who need visual, tangible data and feedback in order to achieve their goals and see progress (i.e. lack of visible progress discouraging them from progressing forward.)  
- Users who need friendly reinforcement, not stress, in order to be consistent with goals.  

## Why didn’t our competitors focus on these Users/Scenarios?

We can conclude a few reasons why our competition did not focus on these niche scenarios:  

#### Market Competition

Many apps aim for a larger audience in order to reach a wider market, and to capitalize on users looking for a general app for tracking activities/habits. Companies cannot focus on niche markets without sacrificing their value and competitiveness.  

### Static Vs Dynamic Habits

Most existing systems consider habits as simple actions without considering the implications of real-life (e.g. missed a reading task because they were stuck on the highway.), implementing a dynamic system may be too out of focus for our competitors due to them needing a general purpose app they can get out onto the market.  

## What would it take for our competition to compete in our field?

#### Our competition would have to begin focusing on the following in order to compete in our niche field:

- Algorithms that analyze a user's productivity sessions and patterns and be able to suggest improvements to their schedule.  

- A change in UI in order to prevent a bloated experience, and enforce calm, straightforward usage.  
- Design a game/streak system that balances motivation and flexibility. A streak system cannot feel stressful for users, or it will defeat the purpose of keeping users on track with their tasks.  
- Provide data that is tangible, not charts that show miscellaneous data with no value to the user.
