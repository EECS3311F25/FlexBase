## Product Overview / Release Goal
<p> Our goal in our V1.0 Release is to deliver a basic habit tracker app to ensure core UI and Feature functions are working as intended. </p>
<p> In later releases, we will be focusing greater on QoL (Quality Of Life) enhancements such as a sleek UI and priority-based habits/tasks. 

## Scope Of Release (Key Features & Epics)

####  Features Refer To The Following User Stories to Implement
