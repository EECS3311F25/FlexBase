## Practices to Continue Using
- Continue mid-sprint check-ins & demos to ensure the program works as intended.
- Continue assisting members in learning new software/libraries (i.e. Java Swing, Github)


## New Practices to Use for Next Sprint
- Encourage more code review amongst members
- Encourage more code-pushing (i.e. more commits.)

## Harmful Practices to Stop 
- Stop working so much near the deadline, especially since the next sprint we lose marks if we don’t do over 30% of the commits in the first week so we wanna do significant work earlier
- Remember to work as a team → It’s a group project! 

## Best/Work Experience in Sprint 1

- (Group) - I believe the worst or roughest experience so far in Sprint 1 was making sure that our team’s Github & Eclipse were linked and working properly. We were having issues with files, opening and running code, and ensuring that our branches also work on eclipse. Our best experience so far was actually solving the issue regarding Github & Eclipse not working properly. It was very rewarding to finally effectively use Github while working on code in Eclipse & having our own branches.
